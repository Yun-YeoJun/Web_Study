  <h2>WEB</h2>
  <p>The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, was originally
    a hypertext document management system accessed over the Internet.
    It has since evolved into the world's dominant software platform. </p>
  <p>The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP),
     may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser,
     and are published by a software application called a web server.</p>
